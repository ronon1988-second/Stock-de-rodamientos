- Reorder Recommendations: Suggest the optimal quantity of each bearing type to reorder, using a tool incorporating historical usage data to help inform the user decision. It will also track total value for all bearing types needed and reordered.
- Reporting: Generate reports showing bearing usage patterns, stock levels, and reorder history.
